## Manual Validation Workflow

1. Run `corepack pnpm mvp:verify` before opening Foundry if you want the full MVP gate.
2. Run `corepack pnpm foundry:fixtures` to refresh the packet if you only changed export/preflight logic.
3. Open `docs/FOUNDRY-MANUAL-VALIDATION.md` for the live Foundry checklist.
4. Record human results in `docs/FOUNDRY-MANUAL-VALIDATION-REPORT.md` or the generated working copy below.
